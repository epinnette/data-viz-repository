# Wireframes / storyboards
I build out my wireframe/storyboard/draft in Shorthand for Part 2 of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
For my story, I want to connect with young, childless adults. This is the population that might not be thinking about parenthood or having children in the immediate future, but may see that as part of their future, perhaps within the next 10 years. Because my story is focused on parental leave policies, I like this audience as a focus because they are the people who could benefit in the near future from any policy changes that may happen. I also think this is a slice of a generation today that wants to create change for their future but might not realize this particular piece of policy and society.

## Interview script
For my user research, I really want to see how the audience understands the story. From part 1, I decided to change what data I'm pulling into this story and simplify it a bit. I want to make sure my message is clear, unified, and has some kind of impact.

I also want to make sure my data visuals make sense and are easy to understand. This is important to me to make sure that the data is helpful to the story; I don't want it to feel out of place in an otherwise cohesive text. And finally, I'd like to see what people think of the overall style for the story!

| Questions               | 25 yr old woman, MSPPM grad student | 26 yr old woman, MSPPM grad student | 25 yr old woman | 26 yr old man, MSPPM grad student |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|In one sentence, how would you describe the story being told through this project?|The story is about how the United States compares globally (specifically, Colombia and Finland), regarding parental leave policies|U.S. policy does not support parentage to the same extent as other countries.|The United States' parental leave policy is significantly shorter/lacking compared to other countries.|The story being told is what policy decisions have contributed to gender disparities in the 
the United States|
|Who do you think would be most interested in this story (or who this story is made for), based on how it is designed currently?|Adults from the United States who are parents or who are interested in becoming parents one day |Legislators or everyday individuals considering whether stronger parental leave policies are needed in the U.S.|Parents who resonate with the lack of leave and would advocate for change; policymakers looking for evidence on a pressing issue; politicians looking for an initiative to rally behind|This story seems to be made for people interested in supporting policy that supports
gender equity|
|What is the apex/climax moment in the story to you?|The description, depiction, and comparison of the parental leave policies (re: weeks given) in the countries selected|Maternity Leave, 2020 graph which compared U.S. to other countries.|When the map zooms in on the United States after reading about the other two countries' parental leave policies.|The apex are the graphs showing the low amount of maternity and paternity leave by 
different countries that show the U.S. as underperforming relative to its comparable
countries|
|What was your final thought about the story/message when you got to the end of the story?|There should be better parental leave policies in the United States, especially when we look at how we are doing compard to other countries|I really wish U.S. would pass policies guaranteeing longer maternity leave and at least SOME paternity leave!|The gendered wage gap combined with poor parental leave policy is impacting young people's thoughts about whether to have kids and participate in unpaid labor|Policy change needs to happen to support families, particularly women|
|What do you think the most compelling/interesting piece of data is shown in this project?|The weeks of leave is very compelling, especially as you can hover over them.|Maternity Leave, 2020 graph and Paternity Leave, 2020 graph|The maternity leave visualization is the most powerful in my opinion due to the stark difference in leave between the US and the other two countries. I wish there was a callout of the values so it's more obvious that the huge difference is on a magnitude of WEEKS. What is the value for the US?|The paternity and maternity leave graphs|
|Which data visuals hurt what you think the point of the story is?|None of them hurt! I think that the Gender Wage Gap section may be more fitting after the section of parental leave policies and before the section on birth rates, as something that is tied to paid parental leave/gender work policies. A sentence or two tying them together would also be good, regardless!|Gender wage gap-- connection with parental leave needs to be clearer, and Birth rate-- I'm left wondering if there is a connection between parental leave policies and birth rate (since birth rate is declining everywhere). Is this is main consequence of lack of parental leave policies, or are there other consequences that should be shown?|The "Difference between median earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men (percent)" graph is difficult for me to interpret--I find myself a bit confused about what the values truly represent.|The birth rate graph|
|Which data visuals help what you think the point of the story is?|All of them help. I love the map at the beginning that compares all of the countries. It is interactive and interesting. All of the graphs are amazing. As I said before, I love that you can hover over them and get the idea of what each country offers/what their independent statistic is. |Maternity Leave, 2020 graph and Paternity Leave, 2020 graph|The maternity leave, paternity leave, and birth rate bar charts are all easy to understand and really underscore the US' lack of leave despite comparable birth rates|The gender wage gap and the materntiy and paternity leave graphs|
|What are your thoughts about the overal project style (photos, colors, layout)? Anything stand out (either good or bad)?|It's great! The pictures are compelling and relevant. I like the black-and-white tone in the pictures and the color for the main visualizations. It is easy and engaging to scroll down. It is simple but informative. It is not crowded with information. It's awesome!|I like the style. I love the actions at the end. The photos are good and layout good. Can't think of any stylistic changes.|The message is powerful and the data you picked represents the issue well, visually. I really like the moving map and highlighted bars on the graphs--and the colors make sense to me. I iwsh there was one more visualization directly relating the wage gap to materity/paternity leave per country--this would allow me as the audience member to see the two main points come together in one cohesive snapshot.|The pictures were great at getting attention and conveying the seriousness of the topics discussed.|
