# Wireframes / storyboards
I build out my wireframe/storyboard/draft in Shorthand for Part 2 of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
For my story, I want to connect with young, childless adults. This is the population that might not be thinking about parenthood or having children in the immediate future, but may see that as part of their future, perhaps within the next 10 years. Because my story is focused on parental leave policies, I like this audience as a focus because they are the people who could benefit in the near future from any policy changes that may happen. I also think this is a slice of a generation today that wants to create change for their future but might not realize this particular piece of policy and society.

## Interview script
For my user research, I really want to see how the audience understands the story. From part 1, I decided to change what data I'm pulling into this story and simplify it a bit. I want to make sure my message is clear, unified, and has some kind of impact.

I also want to make sure my data visuals make sense and are easy to understand. This is important to me to make sure that the data is helpful to the story; I don't want it to feel out of place in an otherwise cohesive text. And finally, I'd like to see what people think of the overall style for the story!
