# Final Project: Part 1

## The project idea

I'm interested in the effect of parental leave--both maternity and paternity leave--on families, children, and the individual parents. In particular, I'm interested in the downstream effects of parental leave policies, such as mothers' earnings and children's development.  I think this is a policy that is often overlooked in national discussions around the gender wage gap, children's outcomes, and family dynamics. As an American, I think the United States occupies a really interesting space in the parental leave policy space. Even though the U.S. is one of the richest countries in the world and a global superpower, there is no paid parental leave policy at the federal level. Without a national standard, Americans who have children face an incredibly different landscape depending on their state and the company they work for. However in many other countries, parents face a very different landscape culturally and in national policy. There are effects on women's wages, men's wages, and children's development because of these policies and I think it's important for adults, even those who aren't parents, to think about what kind of society our policies nuture--or don't.

## Project structure

For my final project, I'd like to create a story about national paid parental leave policies. For the "setup" of the story, I'll show data on gender equity measures in three different countries--one being the U.S.--to set the tone for the overall portrait of gender equity. This is often hard to conceptualize as a measurement, but the OECD does have metrics for this. Then, I'd like to include data on women's and men's wages. I think this helps to paint a picture of a country's gender culture in a very practical way, via wages. I'd like to include some narrative about the relevancy of the data to grad students, just to help contextualize the story to my audience

I think this data will also roll into the "conflict" stage, which is where I'll show the countries' paid parental leave policies. I'll showcase how many weeks each country's paid parental leave policy is and potentially the wage data, as often parental leave policies allow for parents to receive a certain percentage of their income while on leave. Including the U.S. in an definite conflict in the overall story arc, because the U.S. simply falls to the bottom when comparing parental leave policies. Again, here I'll include narrative about some of parental leave's implications.

For the "resolution", I'd like to include a comparison of the birth rates in these countries, because ultimately countries with generous parental leave policies are incentivizing people to have children and making child-rearing easier. For my concluding "call to action", I'd like to
