# Final Project: Part 1

## Summary of the project

### The project idea

I'm interested in the effect of parental leave--both maternity and paternity leave--on families, children, and the individual parents. In particular, I'm interested in the downstream effects of parental leave policies, such as mothers' earnings and children's development.  I think this is a policy that is often overlooked in national discussions around the gender wage gap, children's outcomes, and family dynamics. As an American, I think the United States occupies a really interesting space in the parental leave policy space. Even though the U.S. is one of the richest countries in the world and a global superpower, there is no paid parental leave policy at the federal level. Without a national standard, Americans who have children face an incredibly different landscape depending on their state and the company they work for. However in many other countries, parents face a very different landscape culturally and in national policy. There are effects on women's wages, men's wages, and children's development because of these policies and I think it's important for adults, even those who aren't parents, to think about what kind of society our policies nuture--or don't.

### What I'd like to show

For my final project, I'd like to create a story about national paid parental leave policies. I'd like to showcase a 3 different countries--one being the United States--with differing leave policies. I'd like to start with data on how long my chosen countries' paid parental leave policies are and potentially the wage data, as often parental leave policies allow for parents to receive a certain percentage of their income while on leave.
