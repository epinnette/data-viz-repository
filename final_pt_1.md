# Final Project: Part 1

## The project idea

I'm interested in the effect of parental leave--both maternity and paternity leave--on families, children, and the individual parents. In particular, I'm interested in the downstream effects of parental leave policies, such as mothers' earnings and children's development.  I think this is a policy that is often overlooked in national discussions around the gender wage gap, children's outcomes, and family dynamics. As an American, I think the United States occupies a really interesting space in the parental leave policy space. Even though the U.S. is one of the richest countries in the world and a global superpower, there is no paid parental leave policy at the federal level. Without a national standard, Americans who have children face an incredibly different landscape depending on their state and the company they work for. However in many other countries, parents face a very different landscape culturally and in national policy. There are effects on women's wages, men's wages, and children's development because of these policies and I think it's important for adults, even those who aren't parents, to think about what kind of society our policies nuture--or don't.

## Project structure

For my final project, I'd like to create a story about national paid parental leave policies. For the "setup" of the story, I'll show data on gender equity measures in three different countries--one being the U.S.--to set the tone for the overall portrait of gender equity. This is often hard to conceptualize as a measurement, but the OECD does have metrics for this. Then, I'd like to include data on women's and men's wages. I think this helps to paint a picture of a country's gender culture in a very practical way, via wages. I'd like to include some narrative about the relevancy of the data to grad students, just to help contextualize the story to my audience

I think this data will also roll into the "conflict" stage, which is where I'll show the countries' paid parental leave policies. I'll showcase how many weeks each country's paid parental leave policy is and potentially the wage data, as often parental leave policies allow for parents to receive a certain percentage of their income while on leave. Including the U.S. in an definite conflict in the overall story arc, because the U.S. simply falls to the bottom when comparing parental leave policies. Again, here I'll include narrative about some of parental leave's implications.

For the "resolution", I'd like to include a comparison of the birth rates in these countries, because ultimately countries with generous parental leave policies are incentivizing people to have children and making child-rearing easier. For my concluding "call to action", I'd like to provide a few action items that the typical American citizen could acheive, such as calling representatives to express support for a national paid parental leave policy or supporting paid parental leave advocacy groups.


## Initial sketches

## Data

### Source

I'll use data from the OECD, as this group has collected extensive data on its member countries and this allows for interesting data for each of the three chosen countries. The OECD has downloadable CSV files of raw data, so I will use these and focus on the most recent year collected that is consistent across the three chosen countries and the metrics.

For birth rate data, I'll use data collected by the United Nations, which is publically accessible and can be downloaded as a CSV. This data is more up to date than OECD birth rate data, so I belive it is a better choice for this story.

### How the data will be used

### Link to the dataset

I'll use data from the OECD statistics site, which has a lot of different measurements for many different countries.

## Method for the project

I'll create a Shorthand story to deliver the project's story and showcase the data visuals. I'd like it to flow well and include some family images, to really impress the human element of the story.
