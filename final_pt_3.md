# Final Project: Part 3

## The Final Version
My final project can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/paid-parental-leave/index.html), on Shorthand.

## Changes Made Since Part 2
I received a lot of great feedback from my reviewers that helped me identify changes to make for the final version of my project.

First on my list was creating a more cohesive storyline with the gender wage gap data. At the Part 2 stage, it just wasn't clear how everything I pulled into this story fit together. I knew this change would be in my narrative, which I worked a lot fleshing out a better story. It was also helpful that the [2023 Nobel Prize in Economics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/) was awarded to an economist who researches the gender wage gap, which was a nice inspiration to tell the story well!

It was also helpful that I'd settled my audience as young-adults, since this helped me frame how I'd write this part. I liked framing my story to this audience because I think of this demographic as8 intentional and critical-thinkers, but parental leave tends to be a concern for people a bit older, based on typical ages for having children in the U.S.

I also made some changes to my graphs so that they were clearer. I ended up keeping bar charts, which aren't the most interesting data visuals, but I think it was the best way to showcase the data and I didn't want to lose message clarity by using more novel styles.

A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.

Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.

Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).

Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.

Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).

Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
