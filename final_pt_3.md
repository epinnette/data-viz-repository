# Final Project: Part 3

## The Final Version
My final project can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/paid-parental-leave/index.html), made with Shorthand.

## Changes Made Since Part 2
I received a lot of great feedback from my reviewers that helped me identify changes to make for the final version of my project.

First on my list was creating a more cohesive storyline with the gender wage gap data. At the Part 2 stage, it just wasn't clear how everything I pulled into this story fit together. I knew this change would be in my narrative, which I worked a lot fleshing out a better story. It was also helpful that the [2023 Nobel Prize in Economics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/) was awarded to an economist who researches the gender wage gap, which was a nice inspiration to tell the story well!

It was also helpful that I'd settled my audience as young-adults, since this helped me frame how I'd write this part. I liked framing my story to this audience because I think of this demographic as intentional and critical-thinkers, but parental leave tends to be a concern for people a bit older, based on typical ages for having children in the U.S., so writing to them felt meaningful. Like a bit of a warning to have them start thinking about these kinds of policies before they're in a situation that hadn't realized could happen.- I tried to tailor my narrative to this, but overall my message is relevant to most adults, since these policy issues don't just affect parents, they affect adults without children too.

I also made some changes to my graphs so that they were clearer. I ended up keeping my bar charts, which aren't the most interesting data visuals, but I think it was the best way to showcase the data and I didn't want to lose message clarity by using more novel styles.

I knew early on what I wanted the feeling of my story to be, which was more emotional and thoughtful, rather than a policy-focused story aimed at a policymaker or business client, which tends to be quite dry. I wanted to go with a personal angle and I kept my black-and-white theme and tried to pull in color for my country call-outs. Sometimes it felt a little bland in black-and-white, but I think half of that was due to the amount of time I spent looking at the project and getting a bit desensitized to my design plan.
