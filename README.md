# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the class "Telling Stories with Data" -- but it should be called "Stories that Data Tells"

# About me
Hi! I'm Ellen (she/her/hers) and I'm a master's student studying public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Technology and Public Policy in Pittsburgh, PA.

I grew up in Maine but have also lived in California, Iowa, Washington DC, Michigan, and now Pennsylvania. My first job(s) were in the international development field, which was exciting, tiring, and fun. I most recently worked as a research coordinator, focusing on a large study about treatment for opioid use disorder among people experiencing chronic pain. Check out this [publication](https://journals.lww.com/journaladdictionmedicine/abstract/9900/telehealth_delivered_psychotherapy_for_the.217.aspx) about telehealth for alcohol use disorder that I worked on!

# What I hope to learn
My goal for the class is to learn how to make beautiful and meaningful data visuals to better communicate for policy

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.
