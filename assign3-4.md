# Critiquing and Redesigning a Data Visualization

## Part 1: The Original Data Visualization

The data visualization I will critique and redesign is found in a Congressional Research Service report, "Teen Birth Trends: In Brief" which is prepared by the U.S. Library of Congress. The report can be found [here](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45184).

## Part 2: My Critique

Usefullness: 7/10
Completeness: 6/10
Perceptibility: 6/10
Truthfulness: 7/10
Intuitiveness: 4/10
Aesthetics: 4/10
Engagement: 5/10

First looking at this graph, it is fairly clear with its intent and message, as it is easy to see the title, timeline, and downward sloping trend lines with various age groups represented. It’s easy to put together that this graph shows health data over time.

I think this type of data has to be clearly represented over time to accurately convey the message of changing teen birth rates and using a line chart is very effective for this.

Aesthetically, the graph has some visual clutter with labels on each of the three lines, which I don’t like because I think detracts from the readability and doesn’t help significantly to understand the data. I also think the line colors don’t work toward better message clarity because it took me a little while to piece together that the blue line is the most important graph element, with the other two lines representing subgroups of the data reflected in the blue line.

I think overall this graph is not great, but is fine enough. To redo it, I would try using a different y-axis metric to more easily demonstrate how many teens were having babies over the decades. I don’t love the use of birth rate metrics only because it is a calculated value, which in this case I think limits the magnitude of the issue by removing the focus from absolute numbers.

As a CRS report, this data is published to inform the American legislature of the issue of teen birth. The first sentence of the report states that the CDC has identified teen pregnancy as a major public health issue, so there is clearly an impetus for this data to be impactful to convey this message. Also, although CRS reports may be written to inform Congress, the American public has access to these reports and thus they also have the audience of the general public.

The visual may convey to more informed or educated readers a message about teen birth in the US, but to many in the American public I imagine this graph would take a while to convey the message or perhaps confuse the audience some because of the metrics used and the multiple lines. However, hopefully members of Congress would be able to interpret the graph with ease, but I think the larger audience of the public could struggle. And, ultimately, that would be a disservice to the issue at hand, as it is a public health issue that the general public should be able to appreciate the magnitude of.

I think this evaluation method was effective because it assessed the most important elements of a data visual and requires thought about the goal of the visual and the audience for the visual, which helps frame the evaluation around more than whether a single person understands it.

That said, I think the critique misses an assessment of emotionality (as appropriate). For social issue data, I think data visuals that can invoke an emotional response are often more effective, because this brings back the “human element” that is often sanitized from data. This isn’t assessed in the current evaluation criteria but would be meaningful to consider for this type of data and/or message.
