# Critiquing and Redesigning a Data Visualization

## Part 1: The Original Data Visualization

The data visualization I will critique and redesign is found in a Congressional Research Service report, "Teen Birth Trends: In Brief" which is prepared by the U.S. Library of Congress. The report can be found [here](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45184).

A screenshot of the visualization is here:
